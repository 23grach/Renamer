# Renamer 

The plugin automatically renames layers based on their contents, which helps to keep your Figma files organized. It is able to:

- Highlight containers and elements to create a logical hierarchy
- Define titles
- Display element sizes and colors
- Save component names

The plugin greatly simplifies navigation through complex layouts and improves teamwork by making the file structure understandable for all project participants.
